EXTREME FORGE

http://extremeforge.net

This open source software aims to make it simple to use test-driven
development with Erlang. Just start Extreme Forge at the root of your
project and it will compile all Erlang source files and run all the
tests, continuously, automatically detecting when any files are changed.

Requirements
-----------

Erlang/OTP R12B-3 or above (http://erlang.org).

Installation
------------

Download the tarball, unpack to any convenient location.
Change to the directory to which you unpacked.
From the shell, run the 'install' script:

% ./install

This script compiles Extreme Forge source code, then uses it
to test itself on your platform. It should print out some lines,
ending with "Installation successful".

The *.beam files needed to run Extreme Forge are now located in
the ebin directory below where you unpacked the tarball. That
directory is referred to in the following instructions as
/path/to/install/ebin.

Usage
-----

To use Extreme Forge interactively (for continuous compiling and testing
of your project as you develop):

% cd /path/to/your/project
% erl -sname extremeforge -pa /path/to/install/ebin
Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.6.3 [source] [smp:2]
Eshell V5.6.3  (abort with ^G)
(extremeforge@bill)1> extremeforge:start().

To stop:
(extremeforge@bill)2> extremeforge:stop().

To use Extreme Forge in a continuous integration tool (from the command
line, with a single run of compilation and tests, and an exit code):
% cd /path/to/your/project
% erl -sname extremeforge -pa /path/to/install/ebin -noinput \
> -run extremeforge run > extremeforge.log

This provides an exit code of 0 if all modules compiled and all tests
passed, 1 otherwise.
