- detect -include dependencies and recompile (all? includers?) when .hrl changes
- run recently failed tests first (even after everything passes)
- tests that never end (e.g. infinite loop)
- run tests in parallel
- run a single (specific) test
- interrupt build/test (should saving a new file do that?)
- provide time information (total build/test time, time for each test)
- fixtures
