The following conventions must be applied throughout Extreme Forge
code.

Modules containing process code are named after a being, an agent, an
actor... usually names ending in 'er' and 'or', e.g. tester.

Processes always accept messages from any process and notify responses
by using an abstract Notify function that is passed as the first
argument to the process's init function.

Don't write start() functions that hide the spawning.
